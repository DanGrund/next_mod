Hello future Mod 2ers!

  My sentiments about Mod two with Andrew and Sal are that this was probably the
best learning experience I've ever had. I think they made sure that everyone had
the opportunity to succeed in this mod. They both were highly collaborative and
supportive of our cohort. They created a inviting culture that allowed us to feel
free to ask questions whenever we wanted. That was the key factor in making it
fun for us. I think anyone in our cohort would agree.
