### Reflections on Module 2

###### Principles
1. **When you work all the time, discipline is getting rest:** I struggled from the beginning of this mod. The key to maintaining the consistent work regimen that allowed me to learn the material was a disciplined routine, which meant getting to bed on time. 


2. **Expect that it will take at least an hour to get to sleep after you stop coding / looking at a screen.**

3. **Take time to learn what's going on with the HTTP verbs and how they pass messages through the application:** It took me a long time to have a mental model of what was going on there and it was what really helped lock things into place, especially thinking about feature tests.

4. **Communicate early and communicate often:** If you're struggling or don't understand or are dealing with personal issues, communicate these things before they fester up into a problem. Things move fast here, get ahead of your shit.
