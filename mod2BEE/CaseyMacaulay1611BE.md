##Mod 2 Advice

- You can do this! This mod is totally manageable and there are fewer conceptual hurdles to clear.
- Do you work early, and if you feel like you've got too much time to complete something, challenge yourself to do it quickly, and do it twice.
- Repetition, repetition, repetition.
- Google is your friend. Don't be afraid to reach out to the instructors for help, but they'll want to know what you've looked at prior to reaching out.
- For your projects, don't just leave styling to the last minute. Think about the general direction you'd like to go in right at the beginning and be really intentional about it throughout your project, especially when it comes to having a standard way to create similar views.
- Look into partials before they tell you about partials! Time saver.
- Don't be afraid to delete your whole project and start over, the second time is usually better.
- Even though there isn't a formal way for you to set up a pairing with us, but don't be afraid to reach out to us for help.
- Good luck!
