## Welcome to Mod2

The best advice I can give you for Mod2 is to do the work. There is a lot of repetition in this Mod, and if you pick up the material quickly, it can be frustrating doing the same thing over and over. It is, however, really valuable to do all the work as it helps build muscle memory. This muscle memory is the foundation for your ability to develop web applications. Do all the work, and put all of your effort into it.
