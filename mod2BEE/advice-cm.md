Compared to mod 1, this mod is not difficult; however, the amount of material you learn is much greater. If you don't understand something, advocate for yourself early. I found it useful to have lots of repetition in order to solidify concepts. If you think you understand one of the tutorials, delete your repo, and start again without help from the markdown. 

Mod 2 is also a good time to explore topics you're interested in. If you feel solid with the concepts you're learning in class, push yourself to learn something extra, whether it's related to the mod 2 curriculum or not. 

The hype about mentors is real. Even if you aren't struggling with the material, a mentor can expose you to new concepts and topics you're interested in. Don't bail on your mentors because of project requirements. The projects here are temporary, and your mentor relationship is worth the effort.
