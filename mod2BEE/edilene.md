Hello, Mod 1 students!!!

Congratulations on kissing mod 1 goodbye!!! Module 2 is just freaking awesome! Extra bonus: you will finally be able to send out a link to mom and dad showing all your hard work in an actual browser. But for them to be impressed, please be kind to yourself and do _ALL_ of the tutorials, do your prework's tutorials twice and don't skimp on your HTML and CSS.

Always TDD!!! There are so many moving pieces in Rails that it will help you understand it better and sediment the knowledge. But most important, have fun!!!
